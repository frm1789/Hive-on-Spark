## 20 Essential Unix Commands to do the 80% of the work

I always love Pareto's Rule because it reflects an enormous reality: you can achieve the most only with the most common instructions. 


1) pwd
What is the working directory? Or where are you?


2) mkdir
Make a directory, and create a new directory.
$ mkdir

3) ls
List all the files in a directory
$ ls

4) cd 
Change directory, in the practical way, if you don't include an specific directory, you're redirect to the inferior level of directories.
$ cd

5) cp
Copy one file from one directory to another. As simple as it sounds, if you include all the parameters works in a very smooth way.
$ cp /user/home/file.txt user/home/new_directory

6) mv
Copy one file from one directory to another. As simple as it sounds, if you include all the parameters works in a very smooth way.
$ mv /user/home/file.txt user/home/new_directory

7) cat 
Show the content of a file
$ cat file.txt

8) nano
It is a text's editor, and you can create (if the file doesn't exist) or open a file.
$ nano myfile.txt

9) file
Display the type of a file
$file Download

10) grep 
Look for something and print it.  The name means ‘globally search a regular expression and print it’.
$grep myfile.txt 'hello'

11) lpr 
Send a file to be printed.
$lpr file.txt

12) clear
Clean up the terminal 
$ clear

13) history
Show the list of instructions. Very useful to reexecute previous instructions.

14) man 
Display manual pages for most UNIX commands.
$ man cd

15) rmdir
Remove directories
